PeleAnalysis was supported by the Exascale Computing Project (ECP), Project Number: 17-SC-20-SC, a collaborative effort of two DOE organizations -- the Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration -- responsible for the planning and preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem -- including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering, and early testbed platforms -- to support the nation's exascale computing imperative.
